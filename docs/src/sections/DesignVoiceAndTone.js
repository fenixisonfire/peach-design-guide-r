      <p>
      At Salesforce, we have guidelines we follow when we create written content. We apply the guidelines to text that appears in the app, including on-screen instructions and error messages. We use the same guidelines for other types of information, such as online help, developer doc, Walkthroughs, and Trailhead modules.
      <br></br><br></br>
      Use the Voice & Tone Guidelines to get a quick introduction to our unique voice and tone, and to understand how to apply it to your work. The doc provides some quick writing guidelines, and includes great examples of the voice and tone from the app and the doc.
